# Tuinue Wasichana Backend Development

This README.md provides instructions for setting up the backend development environment for the Tuinue Wasichana project.

## Installation

1. **Flask**: Install Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python: pip install Flask
2. **SQLAlchemy**: Install SQLAlchemy, an ORM library for Python: pip install SQLAlchemy
3. **Alembic**: Install Alembic, a database migration tool: pip install alembic
4. **Flask-JWT-Extended**: Install Flask-JWT-Extended for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication: pip install flask-jwt-extended
5. **Stripe** (for payment processing): Install the Stripe Python library: pip install stripe
6. **Pytest**: Install Pytest for testing the Flask application: pip install pytest
7. **Pytest-Flask**: Install Pytest-Flask for testing Flask applications: pip install pytest-flask
8. **Flask-Migrate** (optional, for database migrations): Install Flask-Migrate for database migrations: pip install Flask-Migrate


## Setup

1. **Initialize Flask App**: Set up the basic structure of the Flask application. Define routes for user authentication, charity management, donation processing, etc.

2. **Database Models**: Define database models using SQLAlchemy to represent charities, donations, users, etc. Create migrations using Alembic to manage database schema changes.

3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication using JWT. Set up endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.

5. **Donation Processing**: Integrate payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe for donation processing. Handle donation requests and store donation information in the database.

6. **Testing and Debugging**: Write unit tests for each endpoint and functionality using Pytest. Debug and resolve any issues.

2. Set up your Flask application and database models according to the project requirements.

3. Start the Flask development server:


4. Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.
